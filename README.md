# Bacterial Foraging

Two-part project.

### Part 1

E. coli bacteria exhibit a particular motion pattern called "run-and-tumble", alternating straight "runs" at a constant speed and brief "tumbles" where they randomly select a new direcction. Although this may initially appear as a haphazard movement that lacks any control or direction towards food sources, it is in fact a viable foraging strategy that statistically directs bacteria towards food.

The purpose of this project is to model run-and-tumble motion and food-depending tumbling to show that it is an effective foraging tactic. The relevance of this study lies in the insights it can provide into how bacterial populations explore and exploit their environment, which could have important implications in fields such as microbiology, ecology, and biotechnology.

### Part 2

In this notebook we further explore whether changing the tumbling rate of bacteria's run-and-tumble motion results in a statistically significant difference, and is thus an effective foraging strategy. To analyze the impact of tumbling rate on bacterial behavior, we create boxplots and error bar plots that compare the samples of bacteria that use the run-and-tumble tactic to those where the tumbling rate is constant. Overall, our aim is to understand the statistical significance of our data and prove the effectiveness of food-depending tumbling.
